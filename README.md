Metropolia UAS, 2018.  
<p>
*Turned out I spelt "chess" incorrectly (I realized it when I typed this document), but it too late to change now (even my sources file use "chest")

Just a simple chess game without any computer player, chess special moves (Castling).

With fake GUI so you have a feeling it have GUI (it doesn't).

And save feature.
